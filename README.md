### Build Section

---

**Trigger a build**

We are using webhooks to trigger a build in Jenkins after every commit to the repository.

**Script to ensure clean build**

This is included in a file launch.sh. We run this script through our Jenkins shell

```
virtualenv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install flask
python -m py_compile app.py

```

-	This sets up the environment.
-	Installs dependencies.
-	Compiles the code

**The ability to determine failure or success of a build job post-build trigger**

We are sending a mail on every failure of our Release job.

**Multiple jobs corresponding to multiple branches in a repository.**

We have two jobs corresponding to two different branchest of our repository(master and dev)
